# INTRODUCTION

FComp is a set of C++ components designed to build games, in order to achieve to best build out these features, I built it whilst building a small prototype shooter game, and at any point, I modularized my code, and fit it into the plugin. 

# NOTES

**Replication Support:** replication in mind.

**Blueprint Support:** built to be implemented and expanded with only blueprint knowledge.

**No Dependencys:** all components are completely dependency free aside from what youâ€™d expect

**Made For Games:** made along-side several projects, in-order to ensure usefulness. 

**C++:** built in cpp to maximise performance, without the use of tick in most cases, almost fully delegate based.
